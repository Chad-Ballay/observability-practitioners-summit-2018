## Notes
List scale and scope of how many actions get boiled down 100's of microservices.

How to monitor the behavior of multiple microservices orchestrated actions?


Monitor transactions.

Skipped over tracing intro.

Walks us through reading a Trace Timeline chart.

Turns out these charts are very suciptible to misunderstanding.  Farro goes over a few examples and explains what it is that he is seeing and how he makes his assertions.

Will be usefull to rewatch if video of this reading of the graphs and bars.
